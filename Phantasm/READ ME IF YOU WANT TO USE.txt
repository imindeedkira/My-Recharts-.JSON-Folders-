Hi! You need the correct mod to use this chart. Here's what you need!


One! You need the Psych Engine (Latest .Ver): https://gamebanana.com/mods/309789

Two! You need the mod itself!: https://gamebanana.com/mods/359046

Three! Once you downloaded the file from Step Two, do the following!: Take "Chaos Nightmare" and drag it into Psych Engine: Psych Engine > Mods > Drop it into the Mods folder!

Four! Restart Psych Engine if you'd started it before, check if the song "Phantasm" is there. If it is, follow the next step and you'll be fine!

Five! Drag "Phantasm-Hard.Json" to the respective folder it needs to go in!: Psych Engine > Mods > Chaos Nightmare > Data > Phantasm! Done! 

Six! Check freeplay, and play the song!!! It's as easy as that!!! Enjoy!!!!
